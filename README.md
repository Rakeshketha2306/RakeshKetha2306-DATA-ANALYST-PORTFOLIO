DATA ANALYTICS POTFOLIO

Hello! I’m an aspiring data analyst with a strong interest in turning data into actionable insights that support smarter decision-making. I’ve been developing my skills across tools like Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and this portfolio showcases the progress I’ve made through hands-on projects and continuous learning.

My projects include interactive dashboards, data visualizations, and exploratory data analysis using real-world datasets. I’ve worked with tools like Power BI and Tableau to build clear, insightful reports, and with Excel to create dynamic dashboards and perform data cleaning and analysis. These projects reflect my ability to structure and present data in a way that is easy to understand and visually compelling.

I’ve also been building skills in programming and data manipulation using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), R, and SQL. My projects include tasks such as data cleaning, merging datasets from multiple sources, statistical analysis, and uncovering patterns that inform business or social insights. I enjoy working with complex datasets and using code to extract value from them.

While I’m still early in my data career, I bring a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and a curiosity-driven mindset. I approach each project with the goal of not just analyzing data, but truly understanding what the data is telling us and how it can be used to improve outcomes.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far and my commitment to continuous growth in the field of data analytics. I’m actively learning and seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, whether through internships, freelance work, or collaborative projects.

Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. I hope these projects demonstrate my passion and potential as a data analyst. I’m excited about the opportunity to grow professionally and contribute to data-driven teams. Please feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out—I’d love to connect!
